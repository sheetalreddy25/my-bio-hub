  <summary>ðŸš€ **Project 1: Sequence Alignment and BLAST Search with Biopython**</summary>

### Part 1: Nucleotide BLAST (BLASTn) with NCBI
#### Overview
This part of the project demonstrates how to access and analyze nucleotide sequences using Biopython. Specifically, it retrieves sequences from a FASTA file, performs BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) search using NCBI's `qblast` API, and processes the results to identify homologous sequences in the NCBI nucleotide database.

#### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Biopython library
- A nucleotide sequence dataset (TP53.fna)
- Internet access (for querying NCBI)

#### Implementation
The script follows these main steps:
1. **Load the nucleotide sequences** from a FASTA file.
2. **Print sequence information** including sequence length and description.
3. **Perform BLASTn search** on each sequence using NCBI's `qblast`.
4. **Parse and display BLAST results**, including sequence IDs, descriptions, E-values, and alignments.

#### Dataset
- The dataset used is the **TP53 gene sequence**, available at:  
  [NCBI TP53 Gene](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7157)
